# Spreadsheet
This is a project designated to recreating a spreadsheet through the use of
software practice.
# Time Estimation
For FormulaEvaluator, I estimate needing 7 hours. A lot of this time will go
into learning how to use VisualStudio and GitHub. For DependencyGraph, I
estimate needing 10 hours. For the refactoring of the FormulaEvaluator method,
Formula, I estimate needing 10 hours for implementing the code and making sure
that it runs as it should. In total, 27 hours will be needed.
# Time Spent
It took me a total of 12 hours to finish FormulaEvaluator. Most of this time
was spent debugging. To finish DependencyGraph, I needed 8 hours. In order to
refactor FormulaEvaluator into Formula, I needed less time than I estimated,
which was 7 hours. In total, I have spent 27 implemeting the spreadsheet.
# IMPORTANT INFO REGARDING VERSIONING
Due to issues with connecting my GitHub repository with VisualStudio, I had to delete
my old repository and create a brand new one, so a lot of my versioning history is
lost.
