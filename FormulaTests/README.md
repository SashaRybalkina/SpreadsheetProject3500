# FormulaTests
This project is meant ot test the code and functionality of the Formula class
and should have a code coverege of 100%.
# Time Estimation
I estimate needing an hour to write and document all of the tests. Most of this
time will be spent testing exceptions.
# Time Spent
I have spent exactly as much as I estimated, which was one hour.
