# FormulaEvaluatorTester
This project is meant to test FormulaEvaluator. It contains tests for basic
expressions, expressions with parantheses, invalid expressions, and expressions
with whitespace.
# Time Estimation
I estimate the testing portion of the assignment to take 15 minutes at most.
Since I am not writing tests like JUnit tests, it will not take a long time
to come up with 20 tests.
# Time Spent
I have spent just as much time as I predicted, which is 15 minutes.
