# DependencyGraphTests
This project uses unit testing in order to test the functionality of the
code of DependenyGraph. These tests should have close to 100% coverage.
# Time Estimation
I estimate that it will take me 20 minutes to come up with enough tests to
cover almost all of the code.
# Time Spent
I have spent a total of 10 minutes writing the tests.
