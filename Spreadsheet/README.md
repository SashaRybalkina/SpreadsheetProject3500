# Spreadsheet
This project stores the information of non-empty cells, and checks for circulations
that may occur with the dependencies of the cells. The project only stores the data
of the non-empty cells and keeps track of all of the dependencies of the cells, but
cannot evaluate the contents of a cell to a value.
# Time Estimation
I estimate needing 5 hours to complete this project.
# Time Spent
I only needed 4 hours to complete the assignment.
