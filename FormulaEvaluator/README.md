# FormulaEvaluator
This project takes in a string expression, and mathematically evaluates that
expression.
# Time Estimation
I estimate that this project should date from 5-7 hours in total. Much
of this time will be primarily spent on learning how to use GitHub and
adjusting to Visual Studio.
# Time Spent
I have spent a total of 12 hours writing and debugging the code. The debugging
certainly took up most of that time.
